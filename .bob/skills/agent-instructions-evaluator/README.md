# Agent Instructions Evaluator

Evaluate agent instructions or agent definitions for operational achievability in production settings. This skill focuses on runtime reliability and runtime efficiency rather than writing quality, identifying issues from hidden state, conflicting rules, vague scope, brittle exact phrasing, underspecified tool behavior, instruction overload, and performance friction caused by excessive or contradictory runtime reasoning.

## What This Skill Does

Produces a structured, evidence-backed evaluation report with:
- Per-dimension scores (0-5 scale) across 5 evaluation dimensions
- Deterministic signal counts (exact phrases, nested branches, implicit state, etc.)
- Detailed findings with evidence, impact analysis, and specific recommendations
- Key risks and high-impact changes prioritized by leverage
- Structured JSON for integration with evaluation harnesses
- Runtime performance risk assessment covering token overhead, reasoning overhead, tool-call overhead, retry-loop risk, and latency variance

## Important Notes on Evaluation

**Model Interpretation:** Evaluations are subject to interpretation by different LLM models. For best results, use a **coding agent with access to a frontier model** (e.g., IBM Bob, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, GPT-5.x, or equivalent) to run the evaluation, as coding agents have tool access and stronger reasoning capabilities for nuanced analysis.

**Using the Report:** The evaluation report is provided **as-is** and should be used as a **guide to improve agent instructions** rather than treated as an absolute score. Different models may score the same instructions differently based on their interpretation. Focus on the evidence-backed findings and recommendations to iteratively improve your agent's operational reliability.

## Core Principle

Score the artifact not by how much behavior it describes, but by how much behavior the agent can reliably execute. More rules do not automatically make a better prompt—more rules often lower achievability.

**Reliability and performance are coupled.** Instructions that are hard to follow are often also expensive to execute.

## Five Evaluation Dimensions

1. **Task Understanding** (0-5): Can the agent understand its primary job?
2. **Scope & Applicability** (0-5): Does the agent know when the instruction applies?
3. **Execution & Tool Grounding** (0-5): Can the required behavior be executed with available tools?
4. **Instruction Followability** (0-5): Can an LLM realistically follow all constraints at once?
5. **State & Conflict Manageability** (0-5): Does the prompt require hidden state tracking or conflicting rules?

## Utility Scripts

The `scripts/` directory contains utility scripts for enhanced evaluation capabilities:

### extract_agent_info.py

Extract agent name, description, and metadata from watsonx Orchestrate agent YAML files. This script is used to:
- Get details about collaborator definitions when evaluating supervisor agents
- Extract agent metadata for analysis and reporting
- Provide structured information about agent configurations

**Quick usage:**
```bash
# Text format
python scripts/extract_agent_info.py path/to/agent.yaml

# JSON format
python scripts/extract_agent_info.py path/to/agent.yaml --json

# Extract specific field
python scripts/extract_agent_info.py path/to/agent.yaml --field description
```

### extract_python_tool_info.py

**Unified Python tool extractor** - handles both regular Python tools (`@tool`) and Flow Python tools (`@flow`). This script is used to:
- Get details about Python tool definitions when evaluating agents
- Extract tool parameters, return types, and descriptions
- Automatically detect tool type (regular tool vs flow)
- Provide structured information about tool capabilities without implementation code

**Quick usage:**
```bash
# Text format (auto-detects @tool or @flow)
python scripts/extract_python_tool_info.py path/to/tool.py

# JSON format
python scripts/extract_python_tool_info.py path/to/tool.py --format json

# Compact format
python scripts/extract_python_tool_info.py path/to/tool.py --format compact
```

### extract_json_tool_info.py

**Unified JSON tool extractor** - handles both WxO Agentic Workflow (Flow) JSON and Langflow JSON formats. This script is used to:
- Get details about JSON-based tool definitions when evaluating agents
- Extract flow/workflow parameters, node count, and descriptions
- Automatically detect JSON type (Flow vs Langflow)
- Support both Flow JSON (exported from flow builder) and Langflow JSON (visual workflows)
- Provide structured information about workflow capabilities

**Quick usage:**
```bash
# Text format (auto-detects Flow or Langflow)
python scripts/extract_json_tool_info.py path/to/tool.json

# JSON format
python scripts/extract_json_tool_info.py path/to/tool.json --format json

# Compact format
python scripts/extract_json_tool_info.py path/to/tool.json --format compact
```

See [`scripts/README.md`](scripts/README.md) for complete documentation.

**Requirements:**
```bash
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
```

## How to Use This Skill

### Sample Utterances

**Basic evaluation:**
```
Use the agent-instructions-evaluator skill to evaluate the instructions in 'agents/customer_service_agent.yaml'
```

**Evaluate a system prompt:**
```
Evaluate the agent prompt in 'prompts/investment_assistant.md' using the agent-instructions-evaluator skill
```

**Evaluate instructions from a file:**
```
Use agent-instructions-evaluator to analyze the instructions in 'docs/agent_spec.txt' and create a report
```

**Evaluate and save report:**
```
Run agent-instructions-evaluator on 'agents/support_bot.yaml' and save the report as 'support_bot_evaluation.md'
```

### What the Skill Accepts

- Raw system prompts
- Instruction blocks for agents
- watsonx Orchestrate native agent YAML files
- External agent definitions
- Design documents describing agent behavior
- Partial excerpts from larger prompts or policies

## Interpretation Bands

- **Very high-risk / Not achievable** → Any dimension 0-1
- **High-risk** → Two or more dimensions ≤2
- **Moderate-risk** → Mixed scores, some fragility
- **Low-risk** → Most dimensions 3-4, targeted improvements needed
- **Strong** → All dimensions 4-5

## Key Signal Thresholds

| Signal | Risk Threshold | Impact |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| Exact phrases | >10 | High brittleness (Rule B) |
| Nested branches | >20 | Workflow navigation errors (Rule C) |
| Implicit state vars | >2 | State tracking failures (Rule A) |
| Subjective classifiers | >7 | Inconsistent routing |
| Hard conflicts | Any | Critical - agent violates rules |
| Tool gaps | Any | Execution failures (Rule D) |
| Prompt length | >150 lines | Attention drift + token overhead risk (Rules E, F) |
| Interacting constraints | High concentration | Performance friction, latency variance (Rule F) |

## Design Philosophy

**Evaluate operational achievability, not writing quality.**

- Focus on runtime reliability, not academic elegance
- Separate deterministic signals from judgment
- Prefer per-dimension truth over averaged scores
- Be evidence-based: quote concrete lines, don't fabricate
- Be operational: focus on production failure modes
- Prioritize high-leverage fixes that improve multiple dimensions
- **Reliability and performance are coupled.** Instructions that are hard to follow are often also expensive to execute.
