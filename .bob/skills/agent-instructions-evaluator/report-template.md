# Agent Prompt Achievability Evaluation Report

## Evaluation Disclaimer

**This evaluation is subjective and based on the evaluating LLM's interpretation of its own ability to understand and follow the instructions.** The scores, findings, and recommendations should be treated as **indicative guidance** rather than absolute metrics. Different LLM models, versions, or instances may interpret the same instructions differently and achieve varying levels of compliance.

**Key limitations:**
- Scores reflect estimated achievability based on known LLM attention patterns and empirical thresholds, not guaranteed outcomes
- The evaluation cannot predict actual runtime behavior across all possible user inputs and contexts
- Tool grounding assessments are limited by the availability of formal tool definitions in the evaluation input
- Findings are based on manual analysis and may not capture all edge cases or interactions

**Recommended use:**
- Use this report as a diagnostic tool to identify high-risk areas in prompt design
- Validate findings through empirical testing with the target LLM in production-like conditions
- Prioritize changes based on severity and operational impact, not just scores
- Re-evaluate after making significant changes to instructions or tooling

### Harness notes
- Preserve deterministic signal counts exactly as summarized from accepted incidents
- Use deterministic signals to **bound** judgment, not replace it
- Do not fabricate counts
- If a signal cannot be determined confidently, mark it as `unknown` and explain why
- The running LLM should extract **evidence-backed incidents**
- The simple tool should count, deduplicate, cluster, validate, or render those incidents
- Do not require the simple tool to call another LLM
```

## Section Guidelines

### Artifact Summary
Keep this concise. The overall verdict should be 1-2 sentences maximum.

### Extraction and Tool Summary
Be honest about the analysis mode. If no tool was used, say so clearly and explain the confidence impact.

### Dimension Scorecard
This is a quick-reference table. Keep entries brief. Full details go in Dimension Analysis section.

### Deterministic Signal Summary
Provide actual counts, not ranges. If you cannot count confidently, say "unknown" and explain why.

### Overall Interpretation
Use qualitative interpretation bands:
- Very high-risk / Not achievable as written (any dimension 0-1)
- High-risk (two or more dimensions ≤2)
- Moderate-risk (mixed scores, some fragility)
- Low-risk (most dimensions 3-4, targeted improvements needed)
- Strong (all dimensions 4-5)

### Dimension Analysis
Provide full reasoning for each score. Quote evidence. Explain why the score is what it is, not just what the score means.

**Special note for Execution & Tool Grounding:** If tools are referenced in the prompt but their formal definitions (schemas, APIs, specifications) were not included in the evaluation input, explicitly note this limitation in the dimension analysis. State that the score reflects only what could be assessed from the prompt text, and recommend that the user include tool definitions and re-run the evaluation for a complete assessment. Example language: "Note: This evaluation is based solely on tool references in the prompt. Tool definitions (schemas, APIs, specifications) were not provided. For a complete assessment of tool grounding, include formal tool definitions and re-run this evaluation."

### Findings
Each finding must have all five elements: Evidence, Why it matters, Deterministic or judgment-based, Score impact, Recommended change.

### Key Risks
Focus on production failure modes, not theoretical concerns.

### High-Impact Changes
Prioritize by leverage: changes that improve multiple dimensions or address critical blockers.

### Rewrite Targets
Point to specific sections, line numbers, or rule bundles that contain the highest concentration of issues. For each target, describe what problems exist and suggest a rewrite strategy (approach/direction) without prescribing exact outcomes or specific line counts.

### Evaluation Harness Handoff
The JSON object should be valid and complete. It serves as a data contract for automated harness integration.
